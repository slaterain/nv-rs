# nv-rs: session instructions

Goal: faithfully reimplement Fallout: New Vegas in Rust/Bevy using the user's
own game installation, with a stable, efficient 64-bit runtime, mod support
and an architecture that supports VR.

Read `docs/MILESTONES.md` first. Read only relevant source and reference
sections. For research work, `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` describes the method and
`research/*/README.md` the tools. `README.md` documents features and commands. Previous instructions
are preserved verbatim in `docs/ENGINE_REFERENCE.md` and
`docs/CLAUDE_REFERENCE.md`; their relevant rules still apply, but their
historical next-step lists do not determine current priorities.

## Working rules

- Derive behavior and values from game files, compiled shaders, Ghidra or
  recordings. No stand-ins or invented behavior; leave unsupported features
  out. Label unresolved guesses in code and topic findings.
- Since 2026-10-05 (decisions in `docs/adr/`): names, types and layouts from
  the Xbox 360 prototype symbols may be used, marked `(Xbox PDB)` (ADR-0002),
  and decompiled logic may be translated into Rust, marked with its address
  (ADR-0003). This replaces the older reference-doc rule "never copy
  decompiled code into the project". Raw decompiler exports, databases and
  executable bytes are still never committed.
- For behavior investigations, start with FNV's Ghidra decompilation, then
  inspect the associated game data and verify in the original game. The user
  explicitly prefers this order over trial-and-error viewer changes.
- Keep provenance: executable address/build, asset/record or recording,
  branch conditions and a regression test for each behavioral fix.
- Rules belong in world/physics/preview/cellview; viewer handles presentation
  and input. Menus use game XML through ui. Core crates have no external
  libraries. Viewer is its own workspace, pinned to Bevy 0.16; consult 0.16.1.
- Preserve the player/camera, aim/head, action-input and per-view boundaries
  in `docs/VR.md`. VR feature adaptations there are proposals.
- Never redistribute game files or modify the user's installation.
- Focus on the active milestone. Small fixes come first only for milestone
  blockers, crashes/data loss or explicit user requests. Keep other work in
  the deferred list.
- Distinguish implemented, tested and compared against the original game.
  Module existence and coverage counts do not prove playable completeness.
- Update the milestone tracker after each batch with evidence, blockers and
  one next action. Detailed research belongs in topic files, not this file.
- Claude and Codex share this file and the milestone tracker. Record active
  processes, changed files and unfinished checks in the linked topic handoff;
  do not maintain competing backlogs. Use the checked-out branch and GitHub
  milestone issues as the shared queue. Use small, bounded agents only when useful;
  use a cheaper capable model and keep one owner for each edited file.
- Explain outcomes and uncertainties in plain English.

## Machine and checking

Project: current checkout, Windows/PowerShell is the tested platform.
Game Data: the contributor's own installed Data folder; never commit it.
Reference cell: GSDocMitchellHouse. GPU: RTX 5070 Ti Laptop, Vulkan.
Research/tools: `%USERPROFILE%\nv-re`, especially findings and decomp.
Read the archive's Ghidra/recording sections when needed.

Inspect Git status before edits. Use a branch and pull request;
do not claim commits, merges or remote synchronization without verification.

For code batches run appropriate checks, including:

```powershell
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo build --release
```

Check/build the viewer separately from viewer/; root checks exclude it.
Run it with the Data path and reference cell; read startup diagnostics.
Tests generate inputs from scratch, using testdata fixtures.

Play copy: `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Desktop\nv-rs-play`. Reproduce F12
reports in reports/NNN from report.txt in the original game and compare.
After merged code batches pass checks, the maintainer packages official builds
using `scripts/package-playtest.ps1`; see docs/MAINTAINING.md. A local play
copy may have its own publication helper outside the repository.
Documentation-only work does not require play publication.
