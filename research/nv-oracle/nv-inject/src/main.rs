//! nv-inject: load a DLL into a new or running 32-bit process.
//!
//!   nv-inject [--dll <path>] --launch <exe> [args...] [--wait]
//!   nv-inject [--dll <path>] --pid <n>
//!
//! The DLL is loaded with `CreateRemoteThread(LoadLibraryW)`. With
//! `--launch` the program is created suspended, the DLL is loaded, and then
//! the program is resumed, so a probe in `mode = inject` has installed its
//! hooks before the program runs.
