# nv-oracle

Ground-truth tools for 32-bit Windows. They answer the question "what does
the original program really do?" by running or watching the original code
on the real CPU, so Rust ports can be checked against facts instead of
guesses. They are step 6 ("Oracles") of the decompilation and rewrite
methodology.

The tools never contain or produce game code for the repository. They read a
private copy of the user's own game exe, and what they write is a private
recording (see "Safety" below).

This directory is its own Cargo workspace. It has no external crates, only
`std` and `core::arch`, and it is not part of the main nv-rs workspace or the
viewer.

## What each tool is for

| Tool | What it does | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nv-call` | Maps the private unpacked exe into its own process at its preferred base and calls one function by address on the real CPU, with the FPU control word and MXCSR you choose. Writes registers, x87 and SSE results and memory buffers. | Golden vectors for pure or nearly pure functions: integer logic, SSE arithmetic, x87 math, and the cases software emulators get wrong (reciprocal square root estimates, x87 transcendentals, precision-control and rounding effects). |
| `nv-probe` | A DLL that sits inside a running game. It patches the entry of functions you list and logs each call's arguments, memory it points at, and (optionally) the return value, as JSON lines. | Live state that cannot be derived offline: real arguments in the opening sequence, a struct's bytes before and after a call, post-INI values of global settings. |
| `nv-inject` | Starts a program suspended and loads a DLL into it, or loads a DLL into a running process. | Putting `nv-probe` into the game on a private copy. |

How they map to the milestone blockers: the Doc look-IK work in
[../../docs/OPENING_LOOK_IK.md](../../docs/OPENING_LOOK_IK.md) needs two
kinds of evidence this directory provides. The helper that normalises a
quaternion with `RSQRTSS` plus one Newton step produces SSE-approximation
results that only the real CPU can confirm bit for bit; `nv-call` records
those as vectors, including which CPU produced them. The angle cap and the
`fAngleMax:LookIK` values depend on post-INI numbers and on real arguments;
`nv-probe` can log a global's value (`dump=0xADDRESS:4`, or
`dump=[0xADDRESS]+0x760:4` for a field of the object a global points to) and the arguments
and returned rotation of a helper on every call. The same pattern fits any
function whose address and calling convention have been confirmed in Ghidra.

Calling conventions and addresses are never guessed by the tools. Take them
from the disassembly, and note that link-time optimisation can create
custom register conventions (see "Known limitations").

## Safety

- Work on a private copy, never on the real installation. Build an "oracle
  install" by copying the game folder, or inject into a running game. Do not
  put these programs, DLLs, manifests or logs into the real game folder.
- Everything the tools write is a private recording: `nv-call` results,
  `nv-probe` logs, snapshot regions. They can contain game data. Do not
  commit them. Commit only small curated test vectors and the facts derived
  from them (addresses with the exe build, constants with units), after
  deciding with the maintainer that they count as acceptable recordings.
  `.gitignore` here already excludes `*.jsonl` and `*.bin`.
- The tools check what they run against: `nv-call` reports the SHA-256 of the
  image in its header. `nv-probe` always hashes the host exe and writes it
  into its log header (`host_sha256`); it refuses to install any hook when
  that hash differs from `host_sha256` in the manifest, or when the bytes at a
  hook address differ from the bytes you expected. Every artifact derived from
  a run should carry that exe hash.
- `nv-probe` refuses to load in the editor (`isEditor != 0`).
- Antivirus programs may flag any DLL injector. Use an exclusion for the
  private oracle folder rather than weakening protection elsewhere.
- Launching the game exe directly may fail with a Steam error. Setting
  `SteamAppId=22380` in the environment before running `nv-inject --launch`
  is the first thing to try; it is inherited by the launched program.

## Building

On the maintainer's Windows machine (PowerShell), from this folder:

```powershell
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc
cargo build --release --target i686-pc-windows-msvc
```

The programs land in `target\i686-pc-windows-msvc\release\`:

- `nv-call.exe` and `nv_call_engine.dll` (keep them in the same folder),
- `nv-inject.exe` and `nv_probe.dll`.

The tools must be 32-bit because they load, call and hook 32-bit code. Use
the MSVC target on Windows. The workspace is only tested with the MinGW
target below; the MSVC build is expected to work (the build script passes
the MSVC linker options) but has not been run.

On Linux, for the Wine tests (needs the MinGW i686 cross toolchain):

```sh
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --release --target i686-pc-windows-gnu
```

`.cargo/config.toml` sets the MinGW linker for that target.

`NV_CALL_RESERVE_MB` (build-time environment variable, default 24) sets how
much address space `nv-call.exe` reserves at 0x00400000 (see below). The
default covers 0x00400000 to 0x01C00000.

The link addresses are set by the build scripts: `nv-call.exe` at 0x00400000
and `nv_call_engine.dll` at 0x10000000, both with address randomisation off
(`-Wl,--image-base=... -Wl,--disable-dynamicbase` for MinGW,
`/BASE:... /DYNAMICBASE:NO` for MSVC). Do not change them without reading
"Why there are two files" below.

`nv-call.exe` is also linked without a safe-exception-handler table
(`/SAFESEH:NO`; rustc asks for one on x86, and the build script's argument
comes later on the link line and replaces it) and without DEP opt-in
(`/NXCOMPAT:NO`, `-Wl,--disable-nxcompat`). Both are about the range the
mapped game will occupy; see "Exception handlers of the mapped code" below.

`cargo test` on any host runs the unit tests of `nv-oracle-core` and the
command-line quoting tests of `nv-inject`. On a Linux host the Windows-only
crates compile to empty programs.

## nv-call

```
nv-call <image.exe> <vectors.jsonl | -> [--snapshot <dir>] [--resolve-imports]
        [--keep-state] [--fpcw <hex>] [--mxcsr <hex>] [--out <file>] [--arena <hex>]
```

### Why there are two files

The image being measured (the game exe) must be mapped at its preferred base,
normally 0x00400000, because the code contains absolute addresses. Every
Windows process starts with a stack, heaps and system data at low addresses
that are not under our control, so a program that asks for 0x00400000 after it
has started may find it taken (under Wine this always happens). `nv-call.exe`
is therefore only a small host, linked at 0x00400000 with a large zero-filled
placeholder, so the operating system reserves the whole range before
anything else can land in it. It loads `nv_call_engine.dll`, which is linked
at 0x10000000 (with ASLR off), and the engine replaces the placeholder with
the image. The host tells the engine where its placeholder array is and how
long it is (the two arguments of `nv_call_run`). The range reserved for the
image runs from the host's base to the end of that array; the host's own
sections behind the array (its import table, startup tables and TLS template)
are not part of it and are never handed to the image. After the takeover the
host's own code no longer exists, so the engine ends the process itself. Before
it overwrites anything, the engine replaces the process's top-level exception
filter (the host's startup code registered one that lives in those pages) with
its own, which prints what happened and ends the process with status 4; see
"Faults" below. If the image's range is not inside the placeholder, the engine
asks the system for it with `VirtualAlloc` (whole 64 KiB blocks) and fails with
a clear message when it is taken (the message names what is there).

#### Exception handlers of the mapped code

Windows checks every structured-exception handler before it calls it. The
loader records, when the process starts, which handlers are valid for the
address range of each image: for `nv-call.exe` that is the range the mapped
game will occupy, so a table recorded for the host would not contain a single
handler of the game (C++ `try`/`catch`, `__try`) and dispatch would end the
process at the first one. `nv-call.exe` therefore has no such table (every
handler inside its own range is accepted), which needs the build script's
`/SAFESEH:NO`. Handlers in memory that belongs to no image, as with an image
that was mapped outside the placeholder by `VirtualAlloc`, are refused when DEP
is on for the process, so the host does not opt in to DEP. On a Windows set to
DEP for every program, an image mapped outside the placeholder cannot run its
own exception handlers; keep the game's range inside the placeholder. This is
reasoning about Windows' checks, not something the Wine tests can show (Wine
does not make these checks); the link options are verified only on the link
command line (see "What was tested here").

### What it does

1. Reads the image file, takes its SHA-256 and parses the PE32 headers.
2. Maps headers and sections at the preferred base. No relocations are
   applied and no CRT, TLS or static constructors are run: only what is in the
   file exists. Anything the game initialises at run time (singletons, post-INI
   settings) has to come from a snapshot. One byte range of the image differs
   from the file: the TLS directory entry in the in-memory copy of the headers
   is zeroed (`tls_directory_cleared` in the header says so). The loader reads
   an executable's TLS directory from the headers in memory each time a thread
   starts or ends, so the image's own TLS callbacks would otherwise run inside
   the harness whenever the called code, or the system, starts a thread.
3. Imports are not resolved by default. Every import-table slot points at a
   small per-import stub. If the called code reaches an import, the call stops
   and the result reports the import's name (`KERNEL32.dll!Sleep`) and the
   caller. `--resolve-imports` fills the table with this system's real DLL
   functions instead (anything missing keeps a stub). Resolving is only
   sensible for imports that are safe to run, such as simple kernel32 calls.
4. `--snapshot <dir>` applies every `<hexaddr>.bin` file in the folder after
   mapping (for example `011dea3c.bin`). A region inside the image (or in the
   rest of `nv-call.exe`'s placeholder array, past the end of a small image) is
   written into it, and a region in free address space is allocated at that
   exact address, taking the whole 64 KiB block it starts in, so later files in
   the same block fit. A region over anything else is refused with a message
   naming what is there: the harness's own code, data, heap, stack or buffer
   arena, and also the host program's other sections (its import table and
   startup tables behind the placeholder array, and what is left of its code in
   front of a small image). Overwriting any of it would corrupt the harness. So
   are two files that cover the same bytes. A region that starts in the free
   pages after another allocation's end, inside a 64 KiB block that is not
   free, is refused too (the system only hands out whole blocks); the message
   gives the next address that works. The header lists each region with its
   size and SHA-256.
5. Takes a copy of the memory the called code can change: the image's writable
   sections (`.data`, `.bss`), the pages of the snapshot regions and anything
   that was allocated for them.
6. Runs each vector (below), one JSON line each, after one header line. Before
   each vector the copy from step 5 is written back, so a result does not
   depend on which vectors ran before it: a static counter, or a run-once
   initialiser flag that an earlier vector set, starts from the same state in
   every vector. `--keep-state` turns this off, for the case where state
   should carry from one vector to the next (the header says which was used:
   `state_restored`, and `state_bytes` is the size of the copy). Read-only
   parts of the image, and memory the called code allocates itself through
   resolved imports, are not covered.

### Vector file (JSON lines)

```json
{"id":"lerp_1","fn":"0x00401230","cc":"cdecl",
 "args":["f32:1.0","f32:3.0","f32:0.25"],
 "buffers":{"obj":{"size":16,"init":"0100000002000000"}},
 "ret":"f32_x87","fpcw":"0x027F","mxcsr":"0x1F80","regs":{"esi":"0x5"}}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Name copied into the result. |
| `fn` | Function address (hex string or number). |
| `cc` | `cdecl` (default), `stdcall`, `thiscall` or `fastcall`. |
| `args` | Strings written `kind:value`, placed by the convention: `i8 u8 i16 u16 i32 u32 bool i64 u64` (decimal or `0x` hex, negative allowed); `f32`/`f64` (a decimal, or `0x` and the exact bit pattern such as `f32:0x3fc00000`); `ptr:NAME`, `ptr:NAME+0x10` (address of a buffer), `ptr:0x1234` or `ptr:null`; `raw:0x3f800000,0x1` (raw dwords, always on the stack as they are). For `thiscall` the first argument is `this` (ECX); for `fastcall` the first two integer-like single dwords go in ECX and EDX; floats, 64-bit values and `raw:` values (even a single dword) always go on the stack. Use `u32:` or `ptr:` for a value that belongs in a register; a `raw:` value cannot be `this`. |
| `buffers` | Named blocks, each `{"size": n, "init": "hex"}`, zero-filled beyond `init`. They are placed in an arena (at 0x30000000 when free, so stored pointers repeat between runs), made fresh for each vector (zeroed, then filled from `init`), and reported after the call. The image's writable memory is put back as well, see step 6 above. |
| `ret` | `void i32 u32 ptr i64 f32_x87 f64_x87 xmm0` (default `i32`). Decides whether ST0 is read and how the value is summarised. |
| `fpcw`, `mxcsr` | Control words set before the call. Defaults: `0x027F` (53-bit precision, round to nearest, exceptions masked) and `0x1F80`, or the `--fpcw`/`--mxcsr` option. Set `0x007F` for a thread whose Direct3D device did not use `FPU_PRESERVE`. Direct3D 9 sets single precision on the creating thread without that flag; confirm what the game's thread really uses. |
| `regs` | Registers to preset, for custom conventions: `eax ecx edx ebx esi edi`, and `xmm0` to `xmm3` as hex bytes in memory order. A preset that conflicts with the convention's own argument registers is an error. |

Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are skipped. A bad line produces a
`{"type":"error",...}` line and the run continues. Exit status: 0 when every
vector ran (faults are results, not errors), 1 when the setup failed (image,
snapshot, address range, input file), 2 for a usage error or when any vector
line was rejected, 4 when the process was ended by an exception that the
harness could not record (see "Faults").

### Result line

```json
{"type":"result","id":"lerp_1","fn":"0x00401230","cc":"cdecl","ret":"f32_x87",
 "fpcw_in":"0x0000027F","mxcsr_in":"0x00001F80","fault":null,
 "regs":{"eax":"0x00000000","edx":"0x00000000",
         "st0":{"raw":"00000000000000c0ff3f","f32_bits":"0x3FC00000","f32":1.5,
                "f64_bits":"0x3FF8000000000000","f64":1.5},
         "fpu_depth":1,"xmm0":"000000...","fsw":"0x00003800","fcw":"0x0000027F",
         "mxcsr":"0x00001F80","callee_popped":0,"cleanup":"caller"},
 "value":{"f32_bits":"0x3FC00000","f32":1.5},"stack_bytes":12,"buffers":{}}
```

- `regs` is `null` after a fault. `fault` is `null` or
  `{"kind":"exception","code","name","eip","address","access"}` or
  `{"kind":"import","name","index","caller"}`. An exception fault is any
  exception that the called code did not handle itself: access violations,
  illegal instructions, integer divide by zero, x87 and SSE exceptions that the
  control word or MXCSR unmasks, stack overflow, breakpoints and single steps,
  a C++ `throw` (`cpp_exception`, 0xE06D7363), an invalid disposition, and
  any code the program raises with `RaiseException` (reported as `exception`
  with the code in `code`). An SSE exception shows up as
  `float_multiple_traps` (0xC00002B5) under Wine; other Windows versions may
  report one of the other `float_*` names. For a software exception `eip` is
  where the system raised it, not a place in the image.
- `st0.raw` is the 10-byte x87 register in memory order (significand first),
  captured only for x87 return kinds and only when the FPU stack is not
  empty. `f32_bits` rounds the 80-bit value straight to single precision, as
  `fstp dword` would; `f64_bits` rounds to double.
- `xmm0` is always captured (16 bytes, memory order).
- `fpu_depth` is how many x87 registers the callee left in use. A clean
  function that returns nothing in ST0 leaves 0.
- `callee_popped` and `cleanup` show who removed the stack arguments:
  `caller` (cdecl style), `callee` (`ret N`), `none` (no stack arguments) or
  `other`. This is a cheap check that the declared convention is right.
- The low six bits of `mxcsr` are sticky exception flags that SSE code may
  set; compare only the control bits.
- The header line has the CPU vendor and brand string (RSQRTSS and RCPSS
  estimates are reported to differ between Intel and AMD, so record which CPU
  made a vector), the image SHA-256 and base, the control words, import
  counts, the placeholder (the range the host reserved for the image, from its
  base to the end of its array, and where the array starts), the snapshot
  regions, whether memory is put back between vectors (`state_restored`) and
  whether the TLS directory entry was zeroed (`tls_directory_cleared`).

### Faults

Faults inside a call are caught by an exception handler record that the call
routine puts on the thread's handler chain just before it calls the function.
It sits behind everything the called code registers itself, so an exception
that the called code, or a system function it calls, handles on its own never
becomes a fault: `IsBadReadPtr` on a bad pointer returns 1 here as it does in
the original program. Every other exception that reaches the record is written
down as a fault, whatever its code: a C++ `throw`, a code the called program
raises itself, a single step, an invalid disposition (anything that is not
handled would otherwise go on to the process's unhandled-exception path, which
under Wine carries on from the raise as if the function had returned, a wrong
result with `fault: null`, and on Windows ends the harness and the rest of the
batch). The only exceptions that are continued instead are the ones a debugger
swallows: the text of `OutputDebugString` and thread names (0x40010006,
0x4001000A and 0x406D1388); the function then goes on, as it would under a
debugger. The recorded exception is abandoned, the thread's handler chain is
put back (including after a call that left its own records on it, or was
abandoned at an import trap), the trap flag is cleared, the FPU is reset
(`fninit`, control word restored) and the call returns to the harness, so one
bad vector does not stop the batch. A stack overflow is recovered too, and the
stack's guard page is armed again, so a second overflowing vector is reported as
one as well.

The record belongs to the harness thread only. An exception on a thread that
the called code creates never reaches it. It goes to the process's top-level
filter, which the engine owns while an image is mapped: it prints
`nv-call: unhandled exception <code> at <address> outside the harness's reach
...` on stderr and ends the process with status 4. The results already written
are complete (each line is flushed). The exception filter that the host's
startup code had registered is not used: its code is among the pages the image
replaces (it is, for any image larger than about 0xA0000 bytes).

## nv-probe

`nv_probe.dll` reads `nv-probe.txt` from its own folder. The full manifest
format is documented at the top of
[nv-oracle-core/src/manifest.rs](nv-oracle-core/src/manifest.rs); in short:

```
output = nv-probe-%PID%.jsonl
host_sha256 = <64 hex digits of the host exe file>
mode = inject
hook look_helper addr=0x00401000 cc=thiscall bytes="55 8B EC 83 E4 F0" steal=6 args=ptr,f32 ret=void dump=ecx+0x170:16,arg0+0x10:12 regs=1 max=500
```

Hook keys: `addr`, `cc`, `bytes` (what must be at the address), `steal`
(bytes to replace, at least 5 and ending on an instruction boundary, or
`auto`), `args` (types), `ret` (turns on return capture), `dump`
(`expr:length`, e.g. `ecx+0x170:16`, `arg0+0x10:12`, `[0x011dea3c]+0x760:4`,
`esp+4:8`), `regs=1` (log all eight registers) and `max` (records limit).
Settings: `output`, `host_sha256`, `mode`, `nvse_grace_ms`, `flush_ms`,
`suspend_threads`, `max_records`. A relative `output` is relative to the DLL's
folder. Mistakes in the manifest are reported with line numbers, and a hook
whose stolen bytes include something the decoder cannot relocate is a manifest
error. A manifest error installs nothing and is written to the log header
(`manifest_error`), in `nv-probe.jsonl` next to the DLL when `output` itself
could not be read. A hook whose expected bytes do not match memory is refused
on its own and the others still install.

### Loading it: injected or as an NVSE plugin

The DLL exports `NVSEPlugin_Query(const NVSEInterface*, PluginInfo*) -> bool`
and `NVSEPlugin_Load(const NVSEInterface*) -> bool`, using only these public
ABI facts: `PluginInfo = {u32 infoVersion = 1, const char *name, u32
version}` and `NVSEInterface` starting with `u32 nvseVersion, runtimeVersion,
editorVersion, isEditor`. Both refuse when `isEditor != 0`. It does not export
`NVSEPlugin_Version`; confirm on the real NVSE build that the legacy `Query`
path is accepted.

Which mode applies is the `mode` setting:

| `mode` | When the hooks are installed |
| --- | --- |
| `inject` | Inside `DllMain`, before `LoadLibrary` returns. Use with `nv-inject`. With `--launch` the program has not run a single instruction yet, so every call is seen. |
| `nvse` | Only in `NVSEPlugin_Load`. Use when the DLL sits in NVSE's plugin folder. |
| `auto` (default) | `DllMain` cannot tell the two apart, so a thread waits `nvse_grace_ms` (default 1500) for NVSE to call `Query` or `Load`. If NVSE calls, it does the work and the thread does nothing; if not, the thread installs the hooks itself. Nothing is installed twice. |

A probe with at least one return-capturing hook (`ret=`) pins itself in memory
once it has prepared its hooks (`GetModuleHandleEx` with the pin flag; the header
says `"pinned":true`). A thread inside such a function returns through a stub
that calls back into the DLL, possibly long after the function was entered, so
the DLL must not be unloaded meanwhile. `FreeLibrary` then does nothing, and the
hooks keep working until the process ends. If the pin fails (`"pinned":false`
with a `ret=` hook in the manifest), every `ret=` hook is refused with that
reason and only the hooks without return capture are installed. A probe without
return capture is not pinned: `FreeLibrary` puts the original bytes back (the
generated stubs stay allocated, but see the limitations for a thread inside one
at that moment).

### How a hook works

1. The bytes at the address are compared with `bytes`; any difference refuses
   that hook (the log says where). The decoder checks that the stolen bytes end
   on an instruction boundary and contain no short branch; `E8`, `E9` and
   `0F 8x` with 32-bit displacements are relocated.
2. A trampoline is built in executable memory: the relocated stolen
   instructions and a jump back.
3. A per-hook entry stub saves flags, all integer registers and the FPU/SSE
   state (`FXSAVE`, 16-byte aligned), resets the FPU and MXCSR so the Rust
   logger runs in a known state, calls the logger with the hook number and the
   saved state, restores everything and continues in the trampoline.
4. With `ret=`, the logger replaces the return address with the hook's return
   stub and remembers the original on a per-thread shadow stack. The return
   stub logs EAX, EDX, ST0 (read from the `FXSAVE` image; ST0 is the register
   the status word's TOP field points at, valid if its tag bit is set) and
   XMM0, then returns to the original caller. It works for caller-cleaned and
   callee-cleaned conventions alike.
5. The patch is a 5-byte `jmp rel32` written with one locked 8-byte
   compare-and-exchange (keeping the three bytes that follow), after every other
   thread has been suspended (`suspend_threads = 1`). A suspended thread whose
   instruction pointer is inside the replaced bytes is moved to the same place
   in the trampoline. All memory the patch routine needs is allocated before
   any thread is stopped, so a suspended thread holding the heap lock cannot
   stall it.

### Log format (JSON lines)

If the output file cannot be created the probe installs nothing and leaves a
note, `nv-probe-error.txt`, next to the DLL.

- A header line with the origin, process id, host exe path and its SHA-256
  (always, `host_sha256`) with the result of the check against the manifest
  (`host_sha256_check`: `match`, `mismatch`, `error` or `not_requested`),
  whether the module is pinned, each hook's status (`installed` with the stolen byte count, or `refused` with the
  reason), how many threads were suspended and moved, or a `manifest_error`.
  It is written before any call record.
- `{"type":"call","seq","tid","hook","tick","args":[...],"regs":{...},"dumps":[...]}`.
  `seq` increases in file order across threads; `tick` is `GetTickCount`.
  Arguments are written by declared type, for example `{"t":"f32","bits":
  "0x3F800000","v":1.0}` or `{"t":"ptr","v":"0x0061FD90"}`. A dump is
  `{"expr","addr","hex"}`, or `{"expr","error"}` when the memory could not be
  read (readability is checked with `VirtualQuery`, so a bad pointer in the game
  becomes a logged error, not a crash).
- `{"type":"ret","seq","tid","hook","tick","call","eax","edx","ret"|"st0"|"xmm0",
  "dumps_after":[...]}` for hooks with `ret=`. `call` is the `seq` of the
  matching call record. `dumps_after` re-reads the same addresses that were
  resolved at entry, which is how a function's output structure is captured.
- Output is buffered and written when the buffer fills, when `flush_ms` has
  passed at the next record (`0` writes every record), on unload and at process
  exit. A crash can lose the last buffered records.

## nv-inject

```
nv-inject [--dll <path>] [--wait] --launch <exe> [args...]
nv-inject [--dll <path>] --pid <n>
```

The DLL defaults to `nv_probe.dll` next to `nv-inject.exe`. `--launch` creates
the program suspended, with the exe's folder as its working directory, loads
the DLL with `CreateRemoteThread(LoadLibraryW)`, then resumes it. Everything
after the program's name belongs to the program, so `--dll` and `--wait` go
before `--launch` (`nv-inject` warns if it sees either one after the program).
`--wait` waits for the exit and prints `process <id> exited with code <n>`;
`nv-inject` then exits with 0 when the program's code was 0 and with 3 otherwise.
`--wait` only works with `--launch` (with `--pid` there is no process of its
own to wait for), and `--launch` and `--pid` cannot be given together; both are
usage errors (exit 2).
The tool reports the module handle
or an error. It relies on kernel32 sitting at the same address in the target
as in `nv-inject.exe`, which Windows does for system DLLs within a boot
session. Both processes must be 32-bit.

## Typical workflows

Golden vectors for a helper: find the address and convention in Ghidra, write
`fn`, `cc`, `args` and `ret`, set `fpcw`/`mxcsr` to what the calling thread
really uses, run `nv-call`, and keep the `value` or `regs` fields that the Rust
test compares against. Mark the test with the CPU vendor from the header and
with the fidelity tier from the methodology (A and B must match bit for bit; C
and D against the oracle with a stated tolerance).

Live state: write an `nv-probe.txt` with `host_sha256`, the hooks and dumps,
start the private copy through `nv-inject --launch`, play to the point of
interest, and read the log. For a function that writes through a structure
pointer, dump the structure at entry and, with `ret=`, again at return.

State that `nv-call` needs from a running game: dump the regions with
`nv-probe` or a debugger into `<hexaddr>.bin` files and pass the folder as
`--snapshot`.

## Tests

`tests/run-wine-tests.sh` builds everything, builds two synthetic programs
from `tests/fixture/target.c` and `tests/fixture/threadfx.c` (original code
written for the test; the second has a 4 MiB `.bss`, a TLS callback and
functions that start threads), and runs 24 groups, most of them under Wine. `PROFILE=debug` runs the same tests on
unoptimised builds with overflow checks. It needs `cargo`, `wine`, `python3`
and the MinGW i686 tools, and writes only under `target/wine-tests`.

- the decoder cross-check: the length decoder is run over every instruction
  of the fixture and of a few large 32-bit programs and must agree with
  `objdump` on each instruction it accepts (the fixture alone has about 9,000;
  with Wine's builtin libraries present, roughly 400,000; no disagreement);
- the program's own `selftest` calls each of its functions on this CPU
  (cdecl, stdcall, thiscall, fastcall; float returns through x87; an
  `RSQRTSS` quaternion normalise; a struct writer; fixed control words 24-,
  53- and 64-bit with different rounding), and every `nv-call` result is
  compared bit for bit: EAX, float bits, raw 80-bit ST0, XMM0 and buffers.
  This includes a function that catches its own access violation with its own
  handler record, whose answer must be the same under `nv-call`;
- `nv-call` on faults (null read, write, illegal instruction, divide by
  zero), an SSE exception that the vector's MXCSR unmasks, two stack overflows
  in a row, import traps, register presets, a wrongly declared convention, bad
  input lines, snapshots (including a region outside the image, later files in
  the same page and in the same 64 KiB block, and a write into a region that is
  undone for the next vector) and resolved imports (an API that handles its own access violation,
  a non-continuable software exception); exceptions that nothing handles (a
  C++-style throw, a code the program raises itself, a single step from the
  trap flag), each recorded as a fault with the next vector still running, and a
  thread-name exception that is continued; the handler chain after a call that
  registered its own record and then faulted or hit an import; two identical
  stateful vectors giving the same answer, and `--keep-state`; the image at a
  different base; the clear failure when the address range is taken; a snapshot
  over the engine's own data, over another snapshot file, or over the host
  program's own sections (its import table, its startup tables, the leftover
  code in front of a small image) refused; a snapshot inside the placeholder
  array accepted, and the header's reserved range ending with the array;
  snapshot files at the 64 KiB block edges (in the unused tail of an image's last
  block, which works, and in the free pages after another allocation, which
  fails with a message that says why); an image with a TLS directory and a
  callback, whose callback does not run when the called code starts a thread; a
  4 MiB image (it covers the host's old exception filter) where the called
  code starts a thread that faults, which ends the process with the engine's
  message and status 4;
- `nv-probe` through `nv-inject --launch` (call counts, argument values by
  type, struct bytes before and after, return values, x87 return, recursion
  order, per-hook limit, refusal on wrong expected bytes, refusal on wrong host
  hash, reported manifest error, a hooked function whose stolen bytes contain
  a relative call, a hooked jump thunk), four threads calling a hooked recursive
  function, injection into a running process, patching without suspending
  threads, `auto` mode both with and without NVSE, and the NVSE exports
  (`Query`/`Load`, editor refusal, unload restoring the code when there is no
  return capture, the module staying pinned when there is); a hooked jump thunk
  and the function it jumps to, both with return capture; the host exe hash
  written when the manifest does not ask for it; a thread inside a
  return-captured function while the DLL is unloaded;
- `nv-inject --wait --launch`: waits for the program, and reports (and passes
  on) the program's own exit code;
- the unit tests of the portable crates, on the host and as 32-bit programs
  under Wine.

`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --target i686-pc-windows-gnu -- -D
warnings` is clean.

## What was tested here and what still needs the real game

Tested in this repository's environment: everything above, against a
synthetic program built from scratch, under Wine 9 on an Intel Xeon with the
MinGW i686 target. The hardware results (SSE, x87 including transcendentals)
are real CPU results because Wine runs the code natively; only the Windows
loader, exception dispatch and API behaviour are Wine's.

Not tested, and to be checked on the maintainer's Windows machine with the
real exe:

- the MSVC target build, and the maintainer's Windows version's loader (the
  placeholder, `VirtualProtect` over image pages, ASLR placement of other
  allocations). The MSVC compile (to object files, not linked: there is no
  MSVC linker here) was checked, including that the exception handler is
  listed in the safe-handler table (`.safeseh`), which that linker requires on
  x86; the link and the run were not. For the host, only the order of the
  link arguments was checked (`cargo rustc -- --print link-args` shows
  `/SAFESEH` and `/NXCOMPAT` from rustc first and the build script's
  `/SAFESEH:NO` and `/NXCOMPAT:NO` last). That `link.exe` takes the last value,
  that `dumpbin /loadconfig nv-call.exe` then shows no Safe Exception Handler
  Table, and that the mapped code's handlers are accepted on Windows are
  reasoning, not tests: Wine does not check handlers;
- how a real Windows delivers thread start and exit to the image's TLS
  callbacks (the tests show that, under Wine, clearing the directory entry in
  the headers in memory stops them), and the engine's top-level filter on a
  real Windows (under Wine it runs and ends the process with status 4 for an
  exception on a thread the called code created);
- how a real Windows reports an SSE exception (the code may differ from
  Wine's), and the stack-overflow guard page handling, which was only
  exercised under Wine;
- mapping the real unpacked exe (its size against `NV_CALL_RESERVE_MB`, its
  import table, its TLS and security-cookie use);
- real functions of the game, their conventions and which of them depend on
  state a snapshot must supply;
- loading `nv_probe.dll` through the real NVSE, and in the real game process
  with its own hooks, DRM and anti-tamper behaviour;
- the probe's thread-suspension patching against the game's real threads,
  and the overhead of hooks on hot functions;
- the Steam launch behaviour of `nv-inject --launch`.

## Known limitations

- Shadow stack: the return capture relies on every hooked call returning
  through the stub. A function left by an exception, `longjmp` or a thread
  killed inside it never reaches the stub. Stale entries are dropped the next
  time a hooked function is entered from a strictly higher stack position
  (one that is already unwound), and that call's return record is simply never
  written. A hooked function that jumps into another hooked function (a jump
  thunk, or a tail call) arrives at the same stack position and keeps its
  entry, so both returns are logged, innermost first. If a return stub cannot
  find its entry at all the original return address is lost, so the probe logs
  a `fatal` record and ends the process rather than jump somewhere wrong.
- Functions the decoder cannot handle: only a defined subset of instructions
  is accepted at a function's start (listed in
  [nv-oracle-core/src/decode.rs](nv-oracle-core/src/decode.rs)). A function
  whose first five bytes include a short branch, a `ret`, or anything else
  outside the subset is refused. A jump from elsewhere in the function into
  the middle of the replaced bytes cannot be detected and would break.
- Write race: the jump is one atomic 8-byte write and other threads are
  suspended, which removes the race for threads that exist at that moment. A
  thread created during the patch, or `suspend_threads = 0`, leaves a small
  window; patching early (`--launch`) avoids it. When patching a running
  process, a thread that is currently inside a call that is itself among the
  replaced bytes would return into the middle of the jump; only the
  instruction pointers of suspended threads are corrected.
- Custom conventions: link-time code generation can pass arguments in other
  registers. `nv-call` presets any register with `regs`, `nv-probe` logs all
  registers with `regs=1`, and dumps can use any register as a base, but typed
  argument decoding only follows the four standard conventions.
- `nv-call` runs the function on the harness's main thread, with the harness's
  stack and thread-local storage: code that uses thread-local slots, the game's
  allocator state, or anything a constructor sets up sees an empty world unless
  a snapshot provides it. An exception that nothing in the called code handles
  (hardware fault or a thrown C++ exception alike) is recorded as a fault. It
  cannot recover from a callee that corrupts its own stack, or its handler
  chain, badly enough to break exception dispatch.
  Code that calls `ExitProcess` (through a resolved import) ends the harness.
  A thread the callee creates (through a resolved import) starts without the
  image's TLS setup (its TLS directory is never given to the loader), and an
  exception on it ends the process with status 4. The harness thread is the
  only one that is recovered.
- `nv-call` puts back the image's writable sections and the snapshot regions
  before each vector, not read-only parts of the image (which the harness maps
  writable, so a callee could change them) and not memory that the callee
  allocates through resolved imports.
- Unloading a probe that has no return-capturing hook while a thread is inside
  one of its stubs or handlers crashes that thread. (A probe with such a hook
  pins itself and cannot be unloaded, see above.)
- Logging flushes on a timer only when another record arrives, not from a
  background thread, because waiting for a thread inside `DllMain` can
  deadlock the loader.
- Readability checks use `VirtualQuery`, so memory unmapped by another thread
  between the check and the read can still fault.
- Only one image can be mapped, at its preferred base, and only PE32 images
  for 32-bit x86. Delay-load and bound imports are not read.
