USAGE:
    nvinspect <TARGET> [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]

TARGET is one of:
    a plugin file (.esm/.esp)  that one file on its own
    the game's Data folder     FalloutNV.esm, the DLC and your active mods,
                               combined in load order (the install folder
                               that contains Data works too)
    an archive (.bsa)          the meshes, textures and sounds packed in it
    a mesh (.nif)              one model
    a texture (.dds)           one texture
    a shader package (.sdp)    the game's compiled shaders, from
                               Data\\Shaders
    an MP3 (.mp3)              one music track, from Data\\Music
    a Bink movie (.bik)        e.g. Data\\Video\\FNVIntro.bik
    a folder of MP3s           e.g. Data\\Music: every track in it and in
                               the folders below

    check                 decode every track, one line each

OPTIONS:
    --grep TEXT       only entries whose name or path contains TEXT
    --limit N         stop after N matching entries
    --plugins FILE    Data folder: read the active plugin list from FILE
                      instead of %LOCALAPPDATA%\\FalloutNV\\plugins.txt
    --official        Data folder: load only the official master files
    --ini FILE        Data folder: read the archive list (SArchiveList) from
                      FILE; by default it comes from Fallout.ini in
                      Documents\\My Games\\FalloutNV, else the install's
                      Fallout_default.ini
    --all-meshes      check-assets: also check meshes no record uses
    --force           extract, obj, png, dump, wav, frames, audio: overwrite
                      existing files

RENDER-CELL OPTIONS:
    --variants        render with both rotation orders (xyz, the game's,
                      and zyx) side by side
    --rotation NAME   rotation convention: xyz (default, matches the game),
                      zyx, xyz-ccw, zyx-ccw
    --keep-root-transforms
                      apply the transform stored on each model's top node,
                      as model viewers do; the game ignores it for placed
                      objects, and so does render-cell by default
    --mark-tilted     tint objects turned on more than one axis, the only
                      ones the rotation order affects
    --arrival N       stand at arrival point N (listed in the output)
    --from X,Y[,Z]    stand here instead (feet position, as the console's
                      player.getpos reports it)
    --heading DEG     face this compass direction (0 = north, 90 = east),
                      as player.getangle z reports it
    --pitch DEG       look up (positive) or down (negative)
    --fov DEG         the game's field of view setting (default 75, its
                      fDefaultFOV): the width of a 4:3 picture; wider
                      pictures keep its height, as in the game
    --size WxH        view image size (default 1600x900)
    --plan-size N     longest side of the plan image (default 1600)
    --cut Z           plan: remove everything above height Z (default: 160
                      units above the main floor)
    --brightness F    view: scale the cell's lights (default 1)
    --fullbright      view: even lighting instead of the cell's lights
    --no-cull         draw the back faces of one-sided surfaces too
    --supersample N   render N times larger and shrink, for smoother edges
                      (default 2)
