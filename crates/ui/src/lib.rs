//! The game's menus, read from its own files and worked out the way
//! FalloutNV.exe works them out: its menu XML (`menus\*.xml` in `Fallout -
//! Misc.bsa`) read into "tiles", each tile's "traits" (position, size,
//! picture, text, colour...) evaluated from the operator chains the files
//! give them, its fonts (`.fnt` and `.tex`) and its text layout, and the
//! HUD (`hud_main_menu.xml`) laid out and fed as the game's code does.
//!
//! What each rule is and where in the exe it was read is in the doc
//! comments; `%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\ui_tiles.md` has the findings
//! with addresses. The menus work in their own units: 960 high, as wide as
//! the screen's shape makes it (1706.67 at 16:9), drawn at screen height /
//! 960 pixels per unit.
