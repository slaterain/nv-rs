//! The lockpicking game, read from the game's code
//! (`%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\lockpick.md`): the menu `LockPickMenu`
//! (class 1014, vtable `0107439c`), opened on a locked door or container
//! the player has no key for (`005180b0` → `0078db00`), drawn from
//! `menus\lockpick_menu.xml` with two models, `meshes\terminals\
//! LockInterface01.NIF` (the lock, its frame and the screwdriver) and
//! `BobbyPin01.NIF` (the pin).
//!
//! The sweet spot (`00791000`): the pick's position runs across the menu's
//! `LPM_DetectMeter` (the main rectangle's width: the screen less four
//! safe zones), 0 at the left, its width at the right. Around a random
//! centre lie six rings, the innermost the sweet spot itself: its length
//! and the rings' spacing come from `iSweetSpotLength{Min,Max}<Level>` and
//! `iConcentricLength{Min,Max}<Level>`, mixed by how far the player's
//! Lockpick is above the lock's requirement (half way to the next level's
//! requirement gives the maximum). Where the pick sits says how far the
//! lock turns (`007908f0`): 90° in the sweet spot, 15° less per ring out,
//! and outside the rings falling from 15° to 0 at the far end.
//!
//! Turning (W, A, S or D, the movement controls) turns the cylinder 90° a
//! second (`0078eb50`, stage 3) up to that limit; at 90° the lock opens;
//! short of it the pick strains (stage 4) and loses health at
//! 1 / `fPickBreakSecs` a second until it breaks (a new pin is put in, if
//! any is left). Letting go, the cylinder springs back 90° a second.
//! Forcing (F) succeeds with a chance of Lockpick − requirement +
//! `fLockSkillBase` (in 0..100); failing breaks the lock for good (a key is
//! needed from then on; the "Ignore Broken Lock" perk entry allows one
//! more). Every number here is the exe's (`FalloutNV.esm` overrides none
//! of these settings), and each rule names the function it was read from.
