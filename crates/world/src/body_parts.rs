//! Body parts: which part of a person or creature a hit lands on, what it
//! does to that part, and what a crippled part does to them. Read from the
//! game's code (`%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\hits.md` §3–§5, and the
//! functions named below) and its records.
//!
//! **Body part data** (`BPTD`): `MODL` the skeleton it's for, then one
//! group per part: `BPTN` its name ("Head"), `BPNN` the node it starts at
//! ("Bip01 Neck1"), `BPNT` the node VATS aims at, `BPNI` where its IK
//! starts, `BPND` (84 bytes, loaded as-is into the part at `+0x5c`: damage
//! multiplier f32 at 0, flags u8 at 4 — 0x01 severable, 0x08 explodable,
//! 0x40 its own explode chance — part type u8 at 5, health % u8 at 6, actor
//! value i8 at 7, V.A.T.S. to-hit chance u8 at 8, explode chance u8 at 9),
//! `NAM1` the limb's gore model,
//! `NAM4` the gore's bone, `NAM5` texture hashes; `RAGA` a ragdoll
//! (loader `005e4d80` / `005e4100`). Parts are kept by type (15 slots,
//! `005e5220`): a later part of a type already in use replaces it.
//!
//! Part types (the game's `BGSBodyPart::LIMB_ENUM`): 0 torso, 1 head, 2 a
//! second head part, 3–4 left arm, 5–6 right arm, 7–9 left leg, 10–12 right
//! leg, 13 brain, 14 the weapon held. People use `DefaultBodyPartData`
//! (`0000001D`; head ×2, 20% of health; torso 60%; arms and legs 25%), the
//! player `PlayerBodyPartData` (`0000001C`: head ×1, 75%; legs 150%; torso
//! 255%) when it exists, creatures their `CREA` `PNAM`, else the default
//! (`005f0f80`, `005fa2e0`, the defaults set up at `005e53a0`).
//!
//! **Where a hit lands** (`008b3ef0`): from the node the hit struck (the
//! bone carrying the Havok body it met), up through its parents to the
//! actor's root (not counted): the first node that is a part's `BPNN` node
//! (found by name in the actor's 3D when it loads, `0092b830`) gives that
//! part; a node whose parent is the weapon's node (the process's, taken
//! here as the skeleton's `Weapon` bone: not traced further) gives 14; none
//! gives no part. So a shot to `Bip01 Head` is the head (`Bip01 Neck1` is
//! its parent), to `Bip01 L Forearm` the left arm (`Bip01 L UpperArm`), to
//! the spine the torso (`Bip01`), and on a gecko the pelvis is no part at
//! all (its torso starts at `Bip01 Spine1`, the pelvis's child).
//!
//! **What it does** ([`part_hit`], `009b6620`): the hit's multiplier (0 to
//! begin with) becomes the part's damage multiplier for ranged hits, 1 for
//! melee weapons and fists; the part loses `100 × damage ÷ (health % ÷ 100
//! × the target's base health)` condition points (`00647a30`), × 0.5
//! (`fCombatPlayerLimbDamageMult`) for the player, × the weapon's limb
//! damage multiplier (`WEAP` `DNAM` f32 at 116); damage after armour,
//! before the multiplier. The multiplier comes last (`009b73d0`): above 0,
//! a sneak attack's bonus if it's at least 1, then the damage × it; with
//! no part nothing is multiplied, not even a sneak attack. A hit on the
//! weapon (14) moves all the damage onto the weapon.
//!
//! **Crippled** ([`hurt_part`], `0089a760`): the part's actor value (25–31,
//! `PerceptionCondition` … `BrainCondition`) goes from above 0 to 0 or
//! less. A person (not the player) whose right arm (5, 6) is crippled
//! drops their weapon, and with a two-handed one the left arm (3, 4) too,
//! unless they ignore crippled limbs (actor value 72). Crippled legs slow
//! them ([`leg_speed_mult`], `00647d10`): × `fMoveOneCrippledLegSpeedMult`
//! 0.85 for one, × `fMoveTwoCrippledLegsSpeedMult` 0.75 for both.
