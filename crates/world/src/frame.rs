//! The game's frame: the calls of `Main::OnIdle` (Xbox PDB; PC `0086e650`,
//! 2,272 bytes, FalloutNV.exe 1.4.0.525) in the exe's order, with the tests
//! that decide which of them run. `main` (`0086a850`) calls it once per
//! frame (`0086b3e3`) on `[011dea0c]`, the `Main` object
//! (docs/FRAME_SKELETON.md, Phase 1 PR 2).
//!
//! [`STEPS`] holds one [`FrameStep`] per direct call of `0086e650`, in call
//! order: the depth-1 rows of `research/engine-map/frame.tsv` (143 call
//! sites, so a function called twice is two steps). Each step has its
//! [`Gate`], the condition under which the call is reached, read from the
//! branches of `0086e650`, and its [`Wiring`]: the nv-rs code that is that
//! step, or open. The stages ([`Stage`]) follow FRAME_SKELETON.md's grouping,
//! which is for reading only: the exe has no stage boundaries.
//!
//! The mode inputs ([`FrameState`]):
//!
//! - **Menu mode** (`[011dea2b]`): `Interface::IsInMenuMode` (`00702360`:
//!   the interface's mode, `[011d8a80]`+0xc, is not 1, `007023a0`) or
//!   `Interface::IsPipboyOpening` (`00709bc0`: the Pip-Boy's state
//!   `[011d8a80]`+0x4bc is 2). Set at the start (`0086e6e1`) and again after
//!   the player's update (`0086e7c9`); every gate from step 23 on reads the
//!   second value. The menu of V.A.T.S. (`VATSMenu`, 1056, V.A.T.S. modes 1
//!   to 3) is a menu-mode menu: `InterfaceManager::Idle` (`0070c4a0`) handles
//!   it under interface mode 5 (`0070ca14`), which is not 1. Sleeping or
//!   waiting (`SleepWaitMenu`, 1012), the pause menu, dialogue and the
//!   Pip-Boy are menus too; the frame has no separate "paused" test.
//! - **Fader visible** (`[011dea2d]`, `00701450(1)` on the fader manager
//!   `[011d8804]`: its fader 1 is on and at alpha 1): lets the process lists
//!   and the AI work run in menu mode.
//! - **Console visible** (`[011dea2e]`, `Interface::IsConsoleVisible`
//!   `00703d50`): stops them even outside menu mode.
//! - **World frozen** (`Main` +7, `[011dea0c]`+7): set only by `00961f50`,
//!   which `00961e30` calls for the console's `ToggleFlyCam` (`TFC`, handler
//!   `005bc260`) with 1, 2 or 5: the free camera with the world stopped.
//! - **Threads** (`iNumHWThreads:General`, `011c3ea4`, read through
//!   `0043d4d0`): 1 runs the AI work on this thread, more starts the AI
//!   linear task threads (FRAME_SKELETON.md, "The actor updates").
//! - **V.A.T.S. playback** (the V.A.T.S. manager's mode, `[011f2250]`+8
//!   through `0044ddc0`, is 4, [`crate::vats::mode::PLAYBACK`]): the scene
//!   graph's field of view is not set.
//! - **Loading**: the start menu (`[011daac0]`) with its flag 0x10000
//!   (`0086efa0`, `004a4080`) skips the loading block; the start menu up
//!   without its flag 1 (`XUserInterface::XUIIsUp`, `0070edf0`) suspends the
//!   loading menu's background thread; otherwise an open in-game loading
//!   menu (`[011da0c0]`, `00705ea0`) is shown (`TES::ShowLoadingMenu`,
//!   `00457d70`).
//!
//! Before any of it, `0086e650` returns at once (`0086e69c`) when Tab
//! (`GetAsyncKeyState(9)`, tested at `0086e682`) and Alt (`0x12`,
//! `0086e69a`) are both held: only step 1 has run
//! ([`FrameState::alt_tab_held`]).
//!
//! The model takes one value of each input for the whole frame. The exe
//! reads `IsInMenuMode` again at steps 18, 106 and 141 and the thread count
//! at each `0043d4d0` step; something that changes in between (a menu opened
//! by the player's update) is not modelled.
//!
//! The disassembly and the decompiler agree on every branch here. The
//! decompiler drops two blocks (`0086ebd7`, `0086ec00`) that test a local
//! the function sets to 0 just before (`0086ebbb`), so they are never taken.
//!
//! The viewer orders its per-frame systems by these stages and steps and
//! runs them under these gates (`viewer/src/frame_order.rs`, Phase 1 PR 3).
//! The player's step, `Main::OnIdle_UpdatePlayer`, is split further in
//! [`player`] (Phase 1 PR 4); the world and time stage's callees in
//! [`world_time`] (Phase 1 PR 5); the AI task stage (the AI linear task
//! threads' work, the Havok step, the actor updates, the sky) in
//! [`ai_stage`] (Phase 1 PR 6).
