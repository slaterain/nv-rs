//! Doors and gates that open where they stand, as the game's own code does
//! them (`%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\doors.md`). Load doors (with a
//! destination, `XTEL`) are different: the game teleports through those
//! without playing anything (`TESObjectDOOR::Activate`, `005180b0`).
//!
//! The rules, each with the function it was read from:
//!
//! - A door's state is its reference's action flag 4 ("open", kept in
//!   `ExtraAction`, `00572d30`), set and cleared as it opens and closes.
//!   `GetOpenState` (`0047b250`) answers 0 for anything that doesn't open
//!   (only activators, terminals, containers and doors do, `0047a490`), 1
//!   open, 3 closed, and while the model's `Open` or `Close` sequence is
//!   playing 2 (opening) or 4 (closing).
//! - It starts open by default (`00561d90`: action flag 8, which the
//!   editor writes as the reference's `XACT` and an empty `ONAM` marker)
//!   or closed; when its 3D loads (`005659f0` → `0047aec0`) the matching
//!   sequence is set to its end at once, with no sound.
//! - Activating it (`0047a560`, the open/close form's part of
//!   `TESObjectDOOR::Activate`): nothing happens while either sequence is
//!   still playing; otherwise the flag flips, the base's opening sound
//!   (`SNAM`) or closing sound (`ANAM`) plays at the door, and the new
//!   state's sequence plays from its start over its own length (`Open` 1 s
//!   on Goodsprings' picket gate). Whoever activated it is remembered
//!   (`ExtraOpenCloseActivateRef`). A model without both sequences just
//!   flips.
//! - When the sequence reaches its end (`00567050`, every frame: a
//!   non-looping sequence is finished once its clock passes its last key)
//!   the door's script runs its `OnOpen` or `OnClose` block (`0047ac70`,
//!   event flags 0x10000 / 0x20000), and the door's collision is put at the
//!   leaf's new place: with the INI's `bAnimateDoorPhysics` off (the
//!   shipped default) the Havok bodies are only re-placed then
//!   (`0047ab40`); on, they follow the leaf as it swings.
//! - `SetOpenState` (`005ced30`) activates the door with no activator
//!   when it isn't already as asked (open or opening for 1; closed or
//!   closing for 0): the sound still plays (it's the base's), and a lock is
//!   not in the way (the lock is only checked for an actor, `005180b0`).
//!   `Lock` (`005cbf80`) shuts an open door at once, with no animation or
//!   sound. `SetDefaultOpen` (`005cebf0`) changes the default and shows the
//!   door as it is now.
//! - People walking a path through a closed door (`009e20c0`, from the
//!   actor's path following, `009e0a00`) activate it when they reach it and
//!   wait while it opens (state 2), then go on.
//! - `DOOR` `FNAM` flags (byte at the record's +0x84, `00517c30`): 0x02
//!   automatic (`00517fa0`: the door gets a Havok controller that activates
//!   it for actors within `fAutoDoorActivateDistance` 300, `00519040`; no
//!   New Vegas door has it), 0x04 hidden (left off the local map), 0x08
//!   minimal use (the AI's paths avoid it), 0x10 sliding (`00518080`: not a
//!   navmesh obstacle, and no Havok change when a person opens it).
