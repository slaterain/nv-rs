//! How people turn and walk, and when they stop, read from `FalloutNV.exe`
//! with Ghidra (`%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\ai_rules.md`; the addresses
//! are given with each rule). The viewer measures and moves; the rules are
//! here.
//!
//! - Turning ([`Turn`], [`walking_turn`]): one model, in code, at a fixed
//!   rate; animations only decorate it. People turn
//!   `fCharacterDefaultTurningSpeed` (90) degrees a second, creatures their
//!   record's `TNAM` (0: `fCreatureDefaultTurningSpeed`, 45); in place × the
//!   INI's `[Pathfinding]` scale (1.5, in combat 2.5; creatures 1.25), while
//!   walking up to 3 × the rate, slower when nearly lined up, with the
//!   forward speed cut on sharp turns ([`walking_turn`]).
//! - Paths ([`advance_progress`], [`arrived`]): the point steered at moves
//!   on in tenths of a segment; a walk ends within the request's radius in
//!   2D, its height within 180.
//! - Reaching someone ([`within_distance`], [`location_radius`],
//!   [`target_reach`]): the game's distance rules for travel, dialogue and
//!   activation.
//! - Packages looked at again ([`PackageClock`]): every 20 s and whenever
//!   the game hour changes.
//! - Avoiding each other ([`Avoidance`]).
//! - People out of sight ([`ProcessLevel`], [`walk_polyline`]).
