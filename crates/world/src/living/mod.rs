//! Living in the Mojave, read from the game's code
//! (`%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\living.md`, plus the functions named in
//! each module): sleeping and waiting ([`sleep`]), hardcore mode's needs and
//! the radiation stages ([`needs`]), pickpocketing ([`pickpocket`]) and
//! being warned off someone's property ([`trespass`]).
//!
//! What these keep is [`Living`] (`GameState::living`); the script
//! functions about them are answered here ([`value`], [`change`]).
//!
//! For the game's menus and the HUD, which draw them:
//! - sleeping and waiting: [`sleep::is_bed`]; [`sleep::may_sleep_in`] and
//!   [`sleep::may_wait`] (the game's refusal, or `Ok` to open the menu);
//!   [`sleep::begin`] when the hours are accepted; then each frame
//!   [`sleep::menu_mode`] (the scripts' `MenuMode` blocks) and
//!   [`sleep::menu_frame`] (`Some(true)` once the last hour has passed);
//!   [`sleep::cancel`]; [`sleep::MOST_HOURS`];
//! - picking pockets: [`pickpocket::use_person`] (what using a person
//!   does); [`pickpocket::Visit::new`] on opening; per stack
//!   [`pickpocket::stack_value`] and [`pickpocket::chance`] (for the
//!   menu's figures) and [`pickpocket::attempt`] with the game's roll
//!   (`GameState::roll() % 100`); a caught visit closes the menu;
//! - the crosshair: [`crosshair_red`].
