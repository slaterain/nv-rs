//! Perks (`PERK`): what they are (`DATA`: trait, the level they open at,
//! ranks, playable, hidden) and their entries, which change numbers the
//! game works out elsewhere or give abilities.
//!
//! An entry is `PRKE` (kind: 0 quest stage, 1 ability, 2 entry point; the
//! rank it belongs to, counting from 0; priority), then for an entry point
//! `DATA` (the entry point's number, its function, how many condition
//! tabs), conditions grouped by tab (`PRKC` tab number, then its `CTDA`s),
//! `EPFT` (1 = a float follows) and `EPFD` (the value); `PRKF` ends it. For
//! an ability, `DATA` is the spell (`SPEL`) the holder has. Read from the
//! game's records: Educated has entry point 10 ("Adjust Gained Skill
//! Points") with function 2 (add) 2.0; Swift Learner 9 ("Adjust Experience
//! Points") with function 3 (multiply) 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 for its three ranks;
//! Toughness 56 ("Modify Damage Threshold (defender)") + 3, + 6. The
//! numbers and names are the game's own table ([`ENTRY_POINT_NAMES`],
//! built at `00f4fa60`).
//!
//! **How the game applies an entry point** (`005e58f0(entry, owner,
//! params…, &value)`, read from the code; `%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\
//! perks.md`): the owner's perk entries for that entry point are taken from
//! the player's lists (player `+0x884`, one per entry point, `00963ba0`);
//! for anyone else the lists are empty (`Character`'s `+0x4ac` is
//! `0050fbe0`, 0), except a teammate, who gets the player's entries from
//! perks given with `AddPerk`'s teammate flag (lists at `+0xadc`; no
//! script in the game's data sets the flag, so that path isn't here). Each
//! entry's conditions are checked tab by tab ("CheckConditionFilters",
//! `005ea060`): tab 0 against the owner, the others against the entry
//! point's parameters in order ([`tab_kinds`], the table at `01196e44`:
//! the weapon, the target, the attacker, …); an entry whose tab count
//! (`DATA` byte 2) isn't the parameter count, or a call with a null
//! parameter, applies nothing. Passing entries run their function on the
//! value in list order (`01197388`): 1 set, 2 add, 3 multiply, 4 add a
//! random value between two, 5 add an actor value × a factor, 6 absolute
//! value, 7 negative absolute value, 8 add a leveled list, 9 add an
//! activate choice. The game's perks use 1–3 and 9 ([`apply_for`] does
//! 1–3; 9 is the activation prompt, not drawn).
