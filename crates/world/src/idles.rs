//! Idle animations: the game keeps them as a tree of `IDLE` records. Each
//! has a model (`MODL`: an animation, `Characters\_Male\IdleAnims\
//! DynamicIdle_ChairSit.kf`, or a folder for a group), the conditions under
//! which it plays (`CTDA`), its place in the tree (`ANAM`: parent and
//! previous sibling, 0 for none) and `DATA` (8 bytes: the animation's body
//! section, loop counts, flags, replay delay).
//!
//! The pick, read from the game's code (`FalloutNV.exe` `005ff2e0` per
//! node, `00600950` over the roots; see [`IdleTree::evaluate`]): depth
//! first, the first passing child in sibling order wins, a node with
//! nothing below returns itself if it's an animation (and not waiting out
//! its replay delay) or a folder flagged "blocking" (`DATA` byte 0 0x80,
//! which ends the search with no idle). There's no random choice in the
//! walk itself: randomness comes from conditions like `GetRandomPercent`.
//! How often an actor asks: [`IDLE_WAIT_TIME`].
