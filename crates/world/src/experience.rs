//! Experience and levels: the player's actor value 24 (`XP`), and what a
//! level brings. All read from the game's code (`FalloutNV.exe`; addresses
//! and details in `%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\levelling.md`). Settings
//! missing from the data take the exe's built-in defaults, noted below.
//!
//! - XP to reach level L (`00648b50`): 0 below 2, else a step of `iXPBase`
//!   (200, exe default) growing by `iXPBumpBase` (150) each level: 25 (L −
//!   1)(3L + 2) with these values (200, 550, 1050, 1700 …).
//! - Every award (`008d5100`): nothing at `iMaxCharacterLevel` (30); the
//!   amount × the player's perks' "Adjust Experience Points" (entry point
//!   9: Swift Learner × 1.1), rounded up, cut so the total stops at the
//!   last level's. The "+N XP" notice; when the total reaches the next
//!   level's, a level-up waits (`008d55e0`) until the player is out of
//!   combat (and not in character generation or a menu), then comes one
//!   level at a time (`008d5210`, `008d5270`).
//! - A level-up gives skill points (`00648c10`): ⌊10 + 0.5 × I⌋ with I the
//!   permanent Intelligence (at most 10), + 1 when the new level is even
//!   and I odd, then the perks' "Adjust Gained Skill Points" (entry point
//!   10: Educated + 2). `iLevelUpSkillPoints…` aren't used by the game. A
//!   perk every `iLevelsPerPerk` (2, exe default) levels (`00784c80`).
//! - Kills (`0089d900`): the player and teammates' damage to the victim
//!   must be more than `iXPDeathRewardHealthThreshold` (40) percent of its
//!   full health; the XP is by the victim's own level: the first of five
//!   level limits it doesn't pass (`iXPLevelKillCreature…` 1, 3, 6, 9, 12
//!   → `iXPRewardKillOpponent…` 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 for creatures;
//!   `iXPLevelKillNPC…` 0, 1, 7, 10, 13 → `iXPRewardKillNPC…` 0, 10, 20,
//!   30, 50, exe defaults, for people); × the difficulty's `fDiffMultXP…`
//!   (1 at every difficulty in this data), rounded down. A teammate's
//!   death counts only when the player killed them.
//! - Map markers 10 (`iXPRewardDiscoverMapMarker`), picking a lock and
//!   hacking a terminal by difficulty (`iXPRewardPickLock…`,
//!   `iXPRewardHackComputer…`: 20 … 60), disarming a mine
//!   (`iMineDisarmExperience` 5), and quests' `RewardXP` (always the
//!   player). Only kills take the difficulty multiplier.
//!
//! Not traced: four interface checks that also hold the level-up back
//! (probably "no menu open"; the viewer waits for its menus to close).
