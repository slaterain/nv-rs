//! The running game: what has happened so far (quest stages, objectives,
//! script variables, items given and taken, what scripts enabled or
//! disabled) and the scripts that change it.
//!
//! - [`GameState`] holds it.
//! - [`Facts`] answers the game's questions about it: the functions that
//!   dialogue conditions ask and scripts read (`GetStage`, `GetIsID`,
//!   `GetItemCount`, …), one implementation for both.
//! - [`Runner`] runs scripts against it (it's the scripts'
//!   [`script::interp::Host`]) and carries out the functions that change
//!   things (`SetStage`, `AddItem`, `Disable`, `ShowMessage`, …). What the
//!   player should see happen (a message, someone starting to talk, a
//!   door being enabled) is queued as [`Event`]s for the viewer.
//!
//! A function this doesn't carry out yet stops the script where its value
//! is needed, rather than going on with a made-up value (which could set
//! quest stages wrongly); as a plain statement it's skipped. Both are
//! counted in [`GameState::unhandled`].
