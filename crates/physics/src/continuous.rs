//! Continuous collision for free bodies: which bodies Havok sweeps against
//! the world, and what the simplified time of impact does to them.
//!
//! The game's world is continuous (`iSimType` 1, Bethesda's cinfo
//! `00c681c0`: `hkpContinuousSimulation`, `hkpContinuousSimulation::
//! collideInternal` `00d0ef40`, Xbox PDB). Each body has a quality
//! (`hkpCollidableQualityType`, [`crate::rigid::RigidSetup::quality`]); the
//! dispatcher's quality table (`hkpCollisionDispatcher::
//! initCollisionQualityInfo` `00cfb570`, at `+0x1bb0`) says, for two
//! bodies' qualities, which collision quality their agent works at
//! ([`pair_quality`]): 1 is a plain step, 2 the simplified time of impact,
//! 3 to 5 the full one. Every clutter model the game ships that was
//! looked at (tumbleweeds, bottles) carries quality 3, debris with
//! simplified time of impact (`00c8d4a0` names the cinfo's qualities; the
//! model's byte is the cinfo's, `00c8ea30`): against the world (quality
//! 0, fixed) that is 2.
//!
//! Traced here (`hkpContinuousSimulation::advanceTimeInternal` `00d0ed10`
//! → `handleAllToisTill` `00d0e9c0` → `handleSimpleToi` `00d0e210`): a
//! time-of-impact event queued by the narrowphase (`00d0d150`, 250 events
//! at most, the world's `sizeOfToiEventQueue`; the quality info's `+0x14`
//! byte marks it simple) is handled in time order; handling a simple one
//! sets each body of quality 3 to its pose at the event's time
//! (`hkSweptTransformUtil` lerp, `00cf1d50`, [`swept_pose`]: the swept
//! transform then starts and ends there, the velocities untouched),
//! drops the queued events of that body and its agents' predictions. The
//! contacts at that pose are made by the next collide and solved by the
//! next step. The rest of the frame's travel is lost.
//!
//! Not translated: how the narrowphase finds an event's time (the
//! predictive agents' linear cast with their cached separating plane,
//! `00cfedd0` and the agent tables at `dispatcher +0x16b8`/`+0x16dc`) and
//! the separation it stops at (the quality info's fractions of the
//! bodies' allowed penetration depth, `00cfb570`); here the first time a
//! body's feature points touch a triangle the step carried them through
//! ([`first_touch`], conservative advancement), and an event is made only
//! when a point ends the step behind the triangle. The full time of impact
//! (quality 3 to 5 against the world, `simulateToi` `00d100a0`: a
//! solve of the contacts at the time, then the rest of the step again) and
//! events between two bodies are not translated: bodies of those
//! qualities step as before.
