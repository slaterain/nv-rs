//! Free rigid bodies: the clutter, weapons and props whose models carry a
//! moving Havok body (`nif::RigidBodyInfo`, motion systems other than
//! keyframed and fixed), falling, sliding, tumbling and coming to rest on a
//! [`Collider`] and on each other, pushed by shots, blasts
//! ([`crate::impulses`]) and walkers, as the game hands them to Havok.
//!
//! Read from the game: each body's mass, inertia tensor, centre of mass,
//! linear and angular damping, friction, restitution, most linear and
//! angular speed and its shapes (hulls with their convex radius, boxes,
//! spheres, capsules) from its model; gravity ([`crate::GRAVITY`], the Havok
//! world's); the step: the game steps Havok in fixed steps of
//! `[HAVOK] fMaxTime` (0.016 in `Fallout_default.ini`, exe default 1/60),
//! up to three a frame, carrying the rest over ([`Clock`], `00c66760` with
//! `iUpdateType` 0).
//!
//! This solver's own (labelled where used): contacts are found between a body's corners (and
//! sphere and capsule centres) and the other side's faces, and between the
//! other side's corners and a body's hull, not edge against edge; a
//! surface added without a body's values rubs and bounces as Havok's
//! default body does (friction 0.5, restitution 0.4, `hkpRigidBodyCinfo`'s
//! defaults); walkers push bodies lighter than
//! `fMoveLimitMass` as unstoppable capsules (the character proxy's own
//! impulse, `hkpCharacterProxy`, isn't translated; the game's proxy has
//! infinite strength).
//!
//! Traced here: friction and restitution combine as the square root of
//! the two sides' product, the restitution kept as a byte × 128
//! ([`combined_friction`], [`combined_restitution`], `00cfd800`); the
//! mouse spring ([`Spring`], `00cbb1e0`); the saved velocities
//! ([`RigidWorld::set_velocity`], `00563380`); Havok's step driver,
//! single-body integrator, solver-path forces and velocity checks, and
//! deactivation ([`crate::havok`], B1 PRs 1–4); the broadphase's boxes
//! and pairs and the simulation islands they merge and split
//! ([`crate::islands`], B1 PR 5); the contact manager (`crate::manifold`,
//! PR 6); the constraint solver for contacts (`crate::solver`, PR 7).
