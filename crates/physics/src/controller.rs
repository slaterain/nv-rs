//! Bethesda's character controller around Havok's proxy
//! (`bhkCharacterController`, Xbox PDB, 0x650 bytes): its listener, which
//! turns the proxy's surface constraints into walkable ground, steps and
//! walls (`processConstraintsCallback` `00c711d0`), the support check
//! (`hkpCharacterProxy::checkSupportWithCollector` `00cae900` through
//! `00c6cef0`), the character states (on the ground `00cd4800`, jumping
//! `00cd4280`, in the air `00cd3fb0`, sharing Havok's movement util

//! Translated from FalloutNV.exe 1.4.0.525 (addresses per function); names
