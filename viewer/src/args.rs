nv-viewer - walk around a Fallout: New Vegas cell

USAGE:
    nv-viewer <DATA FOLDER> <CELL> [OPTIONS]

    DATA FOLDER  the game's Data folder, or the install folder containing it
    CELL         an interior cell's editor ID, form ID or name, e.g.
                 GSDocMitchellHouse (nvinspect's `cells` command lists them);
                 an outdoor cell (Goodsprings); or a worldspace
                 (WastelandNV, with --at to say where; `nvinspect worlds`
                 lists them). Outdoors, the cells around the player load
                 as they walk.

OPTIONS:
    --official              load only FalloutNV.esm and the official DLC
    --plugins FILE          read the active plugin list from FILE
    --ini FILE              read the archive list (SArchiveList) from FILE
    --brightness F          scale every light (default 1)
    --keep-root-transforms  place models as model viewers do (not the game)
    --at X,Y,Z,HEADING[,PITCH]
                            start standing here instead: the numbers the
                            game's console gives for player.getpos x, y, z
                            and player.getangle z (and x, for looking up or
                            down), to line up with an in-game screenshot
    --screenshot FILE       open at 1920x1080, save a PNG of the view to
                            FILE once everything has loaded, then quit
    --wait SECONDS          with --screenshot, let the game run this long
                            first (people walking, scripts)
    --screen-size W,H       with --screenshot or --background, open at this
                            size instead (to check other shapes of screen)
    --walk                  walk even with --screenshot (which otherwise
                            flies, keeping the exact eye position given)
    --fps                   print the frame rate every two seconds, and how
                            long each frame's own work took on the main and
                            render threads (apart from waiting for the
                            display)
    --talk                  start talking to the nearest person once loaded
    --choose N,N,...        with --talk or a script's talking: pick these
                            replies in order (as the number keys would),
                            for playing a conversation through unattended
    --stage QUEST STAGE     set a quest's stage once loaded, as a script
                            would (VCG01 0 starts Doc Mitchell's intro)
    --new-game              start the game: the opening quest (VCG00) from
                            its first stage, which plays the intro movie;
                            scripts take you to Doc's house (the CELL can
                            then be left out)
    --load-fos FILE         start from one of the original game's saves
                            (.fos, read-only) instead of a new game: its
                            quests, globals, inventory, the player's place
                            (the CELL can then be left out); prints what
                            it took (docs/FOS_SAVES.md)
    --character FILE        start as a ready-made test character: a file
                            of the game's script lines (editor IDs) run
                            on the new game before its first frame, plus
                            `level N` (see characters/README.md)
    --movies, --no-movies   play the movies scripts ask for (PlayBink), or
                            skip them; by default they play, except when
                            taking a screenshot
    --weapon ID             start with this weapon (editor ID or form ID)
                            equipped and 50 rounds for it; screenshots
                            then show it in your hands
    --weather-region ID     the player's weather region (editor ID or form
                            ID), as a saved game would have it; it colours
                            glows without an Emittance of their own.
                            Starting indoors otherwise acts as if you came
                            in through the place's door from outside
    --run \"COMMAND\"         once loaded, run a line of the game's script
                            language, as its console does (for example
                            \"SunnyREF.StartCombat player\"); can be given
                            more than once
    --run-at SECONDS \"COMMAND\"
                            for testing: run a script line that many
                            seconds after loading (in the game, not in a
                            menu); can be given more than once
    --say TEXT              for testing: when the dialogue menu offers
                            topics, choose the first whose text contains
                            TEXT (ignoring case); each --say is used once,
                            in order
    --say-id FORM           for testing: choose the offered dialogue line
                            with this INFO form ID; each is used once
    --no-hud                leave out the game's HUD (health, compass,
                            crosshair, messages); screenshots then show
                            the scene alone
    --background            a test run out of the way: the window opens
                            behind the others without the focus, and the
                            mouse is never held in it (with --screen-size,
                            at that size)
    --freeze-ai             people and creatures stand where they are and
                            do nothing but their idle, as after the game's
                            console command tai (for lining up with a
                            recording made that way)
    --pipboy MENU[:PAGE]    once loaded, raise the Pip-Boy on this menu
                            (stats, items or data) and page or tab (from
                            0: stats:1 is S.P.E.C.I.A.L., data:2 the
                            quests); screenshots then show it
    --pipboy-keys K[,K...]  for testing: once the Pip-Boy is up, press these
                            keys in it, one a frame: up, down, left, right,
                            enter, a letter (r: ITEMS' Repair, x: Mod), padx
                            or pady (Shift + Enter, Alt + Enter: the pad's
                            X and Y, ITEMS' Drop with --pad), or close (put
                            it away)
    --pad                   for testing: the menus as with a 360 pad
                            connected (its buttons shown)
    --vats [N]              for testing: open V.A.T.S. three seconds after
                            loading (as V does); with N, queue N attacks on
                            the part it opens on and play them
    --lockpick REF          for testing: once loaded, try the lock on this
                            placed door or container (editor ID or form
                            ID) as E on it would: the lockpicking menu
    --cloud-time SECONDS    hold the clouds where this many seconds of
                            drift put them, to line up with a recording of
                            the game (Goodsprings' reference: 58.022)
    --open-menu MENU[:ID]   for testing: once loaded, open one of the game's
                            menus as the game would: container:REF (a
                            container or a body), barter:REF (a merchant),
                            recipes:CATEGORY (the recipe menu, e.g.
                            recipes:CampfireRecipes),
                            repair:REF (a merchant's repairs),
                            teammate:REF (trading with a companion),
                            wheel:REF (a companion's wheel of orders),
                            quantity:N (how many, up to N), levelup (the
                            player goes up a level; levelup:perks also
                            gives the points and goes on to the perks),
                            wait or sleep (the sleep/wait menu; wait:N or
                            sleep:N also chooses N hours and presses Wait)
    --use REF               for testing: once loaded, press E on this
                            object (editor ID or form ID), as if the
                            player's crosshair were on it
    --menu-pointer X,Y      for testing: put the menus' pointer at this
                            pixel (screenshots have no mouse); the
                            Pip-Boy's too, through its screen
    --key-at SECONDS KEY[:HOLD]
                            for testing: press a key (a letter or digit,
                            mouse-left, mouse-right, escape, tab, mouse-x=COUNTS: the
                            mouse moving sideways each frame, or
                            wheel=NOTCHES, negative out) that
                            many seconds after you're placed, held HOLD
                            seconds (0.1): F third person, R:1 put the
                            weapon away, F:9 with mouse-x=20:1 turn the
                            third-person camera around you; can be given
                            more than once
    --menu-click S[,S...]   for testing: click the menus' left button at
                            these seconds after starting (with
                            --menu-pointer)
    --menu-keys S:K[,S:K...]
                            for testing: type key K (a character, or
                            left, right, up, down, enter) into the top menu at
                            S seconds after starting; tab leaves the
                            hacking and terminal menus, as Tab does
    --answer-boxes          for testing (the acceptance routes): answer the
                            prompts on top by rule as soon as they're shown,
                            as a player would: a message box with one button
                            (OK) with it, one with more with the next of
                            --box-answers (left open when none is left); a
                            tutorial box closed; the name entry accepted
                            with Enter (the name in it). The DLCs' start-up
                            messages and VCG01's prompts would otherwise hold
                            a scripted route
    --box-answers I[,I...]  with --answer-boxes: the buttons (0 the first,
                            by the box's own order) to answer the boxes with
                            more than one button, one per box in turn
