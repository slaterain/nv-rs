//! looked at again every 20 s, on each game-hour change and when forced
//! (`world::movement::PackageClock`); one that sends someone somewhere
//! gets a path over the navmesh (the interior's, or outdoors the 3 × 3
//! squares around the player, joined): first an in-place turn toward it,
//! then the walk at their walk animation's own speed, turning by the
//! walking rule, the body moving toward the steering point while the
//! facing catches up, through the cell's collision with their character
//! controller ([`move_body`]); others in the way are waited for or gone
//! round (`world::movement::Avoidance`), and someone held back 1.5 s is
//! stuck and asks for the way again ([`unstick`]). Dialogue packages walk up to their
//! target and talk; people greet the player, chatter and talk with each
//! other (`chatter` says the lines). Furniture, idles and sandbox packages
//! are `sitting`'s; noticing others, fighting and running away are
//! `fighting`'s. People out of sight walk their paths in game-time steps
