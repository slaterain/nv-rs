//! Faces that move (`world::face`): everyone blinks every 1.5–4 s, and a
//! line with a lip sync file (`.lip`, beside its voice) moves the
//! speaker's mouth, tongue, teeth, brows and lids frame by frame, the voice
//! held back by the lead-in and `fSpeechDelay` so the two line up, as in
//! the game. A line without one leaves the mouth still (the game has no
//! fallback driven by the sound).
//!
//! The head parts' vertices are moved here, on the CPU, before the
//! graphics card skins them: a face piece gets its own copy of its mesh the
//! first time it moves, and is rewritten only when what it shows changes,
//! within the game's distances (`world::face::Reach`). Only positions move;
//! the normals stay as at rest (whether the game moves them isn't traced).
//!
//! Not done: the head turns a `.lip` carries (pitch, roll, yaw; which bone
//! they turn, and in what order, isn't traced), eye tracking (how the
//! look-at point becomes angles, and when it runs, isn't traced) and
//! expressions (moods, a line's emotion).
