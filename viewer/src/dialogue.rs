//! Talking to people: look at someone within reach and press E. They say
//! the first greeting their conditions allow (`world::dialogue`), in their
//! own recorded voice with the text shown. After a line the game's rules
//! (`world::dialogue::after_line`, `00762ff0`) decide: the speaker goes
//! straight on to the line's follow-up (`TCFU`), the menu closes after a
//! Goodbye, or the line's topics come up as numbered choices, or, after a
//! line with none, the main list (`dialogue::menu_topics`: the player's
//! top-level and learned topics the speaker answers). Space skips a line.
//! Only the stand-in text panel (used when the game's menu files can't be
//! read) also ends the conversation on Tab or Esc; the game's dialogue
//! menu takes only its "A"/Enter key (`007628c0`).
//!
//! The menu zooms in as it opens and out before it goes, the player's
//! view held on the speaker's head meanwhile ([`focus_camera`],
//! `world::dialogue_view`).
