//! Lines people say without the dialogue menu (`world::social`): greetings
//! to the player, idle chatter, the lines of conversations between two
//! people, and "Say To" dialogue packages. The game says these through its
//! GREET procedure (`008dbe30`) and a conversation's playback (`009ee0a0`):
//! each line in its speaker's voice, one response after another, with its
//! lip sync (`faces`); its result scripts run as it starts and after it's
//! said, as the dialogue's do. No text is shown (the game's general
//! subtitles are off by default); the lines are printed.
//!
//! Not done: the voices aren't placed in the world (they play at full
//! volume wherever the speaker is; the game's 3D sound isn't traced here).
