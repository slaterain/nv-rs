//! Each of `world::frame`'s stages is a system set ([`FrameSet::Stage`]),
//! run in the exe's order ([`world::frame::stages`]), and so is each of its
//! steps ([`FrameSet::Step`], an index into `world::frame::STEPS`, inside

//! the step's set; one that belongs to a stage without being one step goes
//! in the stage's set. Each set runs under its gate from `world::frame`
//! ([`world::frame::step_runs`], [`world::frame::stage_reached`]),
//! evaluated on one [`FrameState`] ([`ThisFrame`]) filled once per frame
//! by [`begin_frame`], the first system of the first stage.
//!
//! Two sets run ahead of the stages and one after them
//! ([`ViewerSet`]); see there for what they hold and why.
//!
//! The player's step (`Main::OnIdle_UpdatePlayer`, step 14) is split
//! further into its calls and `PlayerCharacter::Update`'s sub-steps

//! split into their sub-steps ([`WorldSet`], `world::frame::world_time`,
//! docs/FRAME_SKELETON.md "PR 5 result"), under their gates on [`ThisWorld`].
//!
//! The AI task stage (the AI linear task threads' work between
//! `AILinearTaskThreadManager::StartThreads` and `WaitForThreads`, and the
