//! How frames reach the window: mailbox where the window's surface takes it.
//!
//! With Bevy's default (`AutoVsync`, first-in first-out) each frame waits
//! its turn for the display: no tearing, but a window that isn't in front
//! (another window over it, or the viewer started from a terminal) is held
//! to 60 frames a second however fast the frames are made. Mailbox shows
//! the newest finished frame at each refresh instead: still no tearing,
//! and the frame rate isn't held to the display's. The surface's own modes
//! are asked first (Bevy doesn't fall back from a mode the surface lacks);
//! without mailbox the default stays.
