//! People and creatures moving: each placed actor gets a root entity where
//! it stands and one joint entity per bone of its skeleton; its pieces are
//! skinned meshes on those joints (the lit shader skins them, `SKINNED` in
//! `game_lit.wgsl`), and every frame the joints take the pose its
//! animations give.
//!
//! The animations are played as the game plays them
//! (`world::animation`), picked each frame as `Actor::PickAnimations`
//! picks them (`world::animation::pick`): the group for what the actor
//! does (standing, walking, running or sneaking in a direction, turning in
//! place, drawing or putting away the weapon, aiming, attacking) with its
//! weapon kind and movement kind, looked up in the files its 3D loads
//! (`anim_library`) with the game's fallbacks; the seat's loop in place of
//! the idle; sitting down, getting up and the tree's idles in the
//! special-idle section. A change of group cross-fades over the files'
//! blend times, the sequences blended per bone by their priorities. The
//! frame's flags (`walking`, `running`, `fighting`, …, set by `ai`,
//! `fighting`, `sitting` and `player_body`) stand for the game's mover and
//! process state.
